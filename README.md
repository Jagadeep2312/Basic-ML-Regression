# 🏋️‍♂️ Basic Machine Learning – Regression Project (Gym & Diet Analysis)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates **basic machine learning regression concepts** using a **gym and diet dataset**.
The goal is to predict **calories**, analyze **workouts**, calculate **BMI**, and estimate **daily calorie needs** based on user input.

It is designed for **beginners** who want hands-on experience with **regression models** and real-world health-related data.

---

## 📂 Dataset Description

The dataset includes information related to:

* Food items and their calorie values
* Workout types and calories burned
* Height, weight, and age
* BMI and daily calorie intake

File:

```
Gym_Diet.csv
```
